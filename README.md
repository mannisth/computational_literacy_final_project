# computational_literacy_final_project

The aim of this project is to uncover differences between five Finnish government programs released since 2014. The programs include: Stubb, Sipil√§, Rinne, Marin and Orpo. Differences are measured by looking at the most common words used, the relative frequency of keywords used regarding 3 distinct topics, and language complexity, with sentence length, average number of subordinate conjunctions and relative pronouns per sentence as variables. 

This project includes:

- PDF-file describing the project and the workflow as well as the analysis of data
- An Excel sheet listing the most commonly used words of each program and their counts
- An excel sheet listing the counts of subordinate conjunctions and relative pronouns used in the programs, and the calculations related to them
